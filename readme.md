# CMS
## Overview
## Choosing a Database
Cassandra vs MongoDB
Cassandra has multiple master nodes so write speeds are improved
Mongodb has a single primary node that is used for writes and multiple secondary nodes which are used for read.

> A good guess is that the CMS see more reads than write, so mongodb can work
